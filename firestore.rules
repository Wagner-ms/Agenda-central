/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the "Agenda Central" application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces role-based access control, primarily distinguishing between 'coordinator' and 'telemarketing' roles.
 * It also enforces ownership for user-specific data. Structural segregation and denormalization are used to
 * optimize read performance and ensure secure list operations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /authorizations/{authorizationId}: Authorization records.
 * - /schedules/{scheduleId}: Schedule appointment data.
 * - /users/{userId}: User data.
 * - /roles_coordinator/{userId}: Documents indicating coordinator role.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Coordinators have broader access than telemarketing agents. Coordinator status is granted via the presence
 *   of a document in the `/roles_coordinator/{userId}` collection.
 * - Schedule listing is optimized using denormalized fields (`escola`, `atendenteId`) to avoid costly `get()` calls.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `schedules` collection denormalizes `escola` and `atendenteId` from the `authorizations` document.
 *   This allows listing schedules by school or telemarketing agent without needing to read the authorization document.
