/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the "Agenda Central" application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with ownership constraints.
 * Users have specific roles (coordinator, telemarketing) that determine their data access privileges.
 * Data access is further restricted by ownership, ensuring users can only modify data they own or are explicitly authorized to manage.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /authorizations/{authorizationId}: Stores authorization records.
 * - /schedules/{scheduleId}: Stores scheduled appointments.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user data, including roles.
 * - /roles_coordinator/{userId}: Presence of a document indicates coordinator role for the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Coordinators, identified by the presence of a document under `/roles_coordinator/{userId}`, have broad read access.
 * - Telemarketing agents can only list schedules where `atendenteId` matches their user ID.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles (/users/{userId}).
 * - Data validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping, focusing only on authorization-critical fields.
